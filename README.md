## Academic Review Pratice for Programming Language II Exam

Well, my PLII exam is tomorrow and I thought that make this project to the exam was a good idea to pratice under pressure. I setted my timer to 80min(1h20) and started my pratice. Fortunately I finished it like about... 6 minutes earlier.

This code is very simple, it's not meant to be a full and complete project.
The project consists in a system that contains clients, employees, products, items and that all are inserted in a view class "Mercado". "Mercado" implements it all.

Hope that it can help someone to learn this beautiful language too.
(Remember that C/C++ it's the most beautiful programming language ever created!)
See ya!
